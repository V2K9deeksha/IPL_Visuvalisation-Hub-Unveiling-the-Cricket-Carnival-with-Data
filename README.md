## Project Overview

This project entails a meticulous analysis of ball-by-ball data sourced from the Indian Premier League (IPL). Employing web scraping techniques, we've diligently collected this data to construct an engaging and interactive webpage utilizing Streamlit. In addition, we've seamlessly integrated Power BI dashboards to elevate the depth and breadth of our visual insights.

## Data Collection

The ball-by-ball data for IPL matches was collected from [source website] using web scraping techniques. The data includes information on matches, players, runs, wickets, and more.

## Web Scraping

The web scraping initiative encompassed the extraction of pertinent information from the source website. Leveraging Python libraries, specifically BeautifulSoup and requests, we meticulously scraped and parsed the data. Subsequently, a meticulous cleaning and processing phase ensued to refine the scraped data, ensuring its readiness for subsequent in-depth analysis.

## Power BI Dashboards

Power BI dashboards have been integrated to provide a more comprehensive view of the IPL data. The dashboards include additional visualizations and insights that complement the analysis done in Streamlit.
